Issues: At first, I was trying to use display: none; and display: block; for the sub-menus. However, I learned that you cannot add a transition to the display property. So, I used opacity and visibility instead. I also feel like I probably used more JS code than needed.  

Resources: This StackOverflow link showed me that I could not add a transition to the display property in CSS, and showed me how to use the opacity and visibility instead. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16546103/css-menu-transitions-not-working?rq=1
